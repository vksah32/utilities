This repo contains some helpful bash scripts.

## Scripts

#### *- uploadPicsToGithub.sh*
 This script uploads pics to my github repo "screenshots". I used this script in Typora Editor; I set my Typora editor to invoke this script whenever I  drag and drop an image file to a markdown file I am writing. Its really helpful when I am writing something and need to insert an image. To make the article self-contained (not referring to local image files), I prefer to add sharable links to images so that they can be rendered anywhere.
